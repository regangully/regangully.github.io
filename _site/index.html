            <p>Hello! My name is Regan, funnily enough. I am a kiwi Software Engineer who currently lives and works in
              little-ole' Aotearoa, New Zealand.<p>
                I have always had a passion for creating things. Nowadays I use this creativity to design and develop
                software to impact, excite and positively influence people.
                <p>When I'm not busy developing I like to pass the time having a hit around at tennis, and cheering on
                  the greatest-of-all-time, Roger Federer.
                  I also like to embrace my inner rock-star and strum out a tune on my guitar when I get the chance.</p>

              <p>Smudge is a leading New Zealand software development company based in Christchurch. It develops
                high-quality consumer facing and enterprise apps for reknowned clients such as Coca-Cola Amatil, SKY NZ
                and NZ Police.</p>

              <p>During my time at Smudge I have employed software-engineering development practices such as Scrum,
                rapid-prototyping and Smudge's intention-based design methodology, to deliver projects that meet client
                requirements.</p>

              <p>
                Smudge's culture is fast-paced and cross-functional meaning that I have had the chance to work with the
                team to build a wide variety of software systems. This has helped me to further refine
                my skills in client-consultation, UI/UX design, mobile development in iOS and Android, and ReactJS web
                development.

              <p>SKOPE is a long-running manufacturer of high quality refrigeration units in Australia and New Zealand.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a software engineering intern with the company I worked with the Engineering and IT departments to
                develop a new system to be able to easily
                monitor and analyse refrigeration data retrieved from units in the field.
              </p>

              <p>
                I spent time evaluating and understanding the existing data acquisition processes to ensure the end
                result would be able to meet the needs of engineers and testers in the department.
              </p>

              <p>
                I relied upon modern, and predominately open-source technologies such as Python,
                JavaScript, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, and Microsoft SQL. These allowed for a light-weight,
                cost-effective, and maintainable solution.

                for a clients of all sizes.</p>

              <p>As my first real-world software development employment, eStar gave me invaluable experience and
                inspiration. I got to apply technical
                skills that I had been learning in my studies to adapt the existing C#, XSLT and SQL code-base. It was
                also my first chance to feel the
                excitement of seeing work that I had a hand in creating go-live and have an impact on the shopping
                experience of thousands of customers.

                At UC I worked hard to establish a good understanding of technical and process skills that are required

                further expanded my ability to manage myself under pressure and
                to balance the differing perspectives that occur when working as a part of a team.
